About "PotentDraw"

- - - - - -



The Potent Draw program is a C++ basic drawing application that uses your mouse and keyboard.



It was made by Austin Jackson, of John H Reagan High School, in Houston, Texas, at the age of 15.

You can find the latest version of it at: http://www.ruthlessphysics.com/potent/



and give feedback (even suggestions!) on twitter: @MacPhage

The Microsoft Windows version was developed/compiled with Bloodshed(c) Dev-C++.


Due to the current graphics library being used in this program, it is only for the Windows platform. :(

My software does not contain and is not a harmful program or virus.
You can even look at the source code yourself (in the "src" folder) to make sure of it.





Thanks for downloading my software! :)
